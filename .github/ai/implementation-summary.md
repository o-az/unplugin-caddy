# Unplugin Caddy Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of `unplugin-caddy`, a plugin that provides HTTPS access for local development across multiple build tools using the Caddy web server.

## Initial Discussion

The user requested to create an unplugin plugin for Caddy that would work with Vite and other build tools. The primary goal was to help developers who want to have HTTPS access when developing locally.

### Context Provided

- **Unplugin**: A unified plugin system that allows creating plugins compatible with multiple build tools (Vite, Rollup, webpack, esbuild, etc.)
- **Caddy**: A modern web server with automatic HTTPS capabilities, perfect for local development with trusted certificates

## Proposed Solution

### Architecture Plan

1. **Plugin Structure**
   - Use unplugin's factory pattern to create a plugin that manages a Caddy server instance
   - Integrate with each build tool's dev server lifecycle (start/stop)
   - Generate Caddyfile configurations dynamically based on plugin options
   - Proxy requests between the build tool's dev server and Caddy

2. **Key Features**
   - Automatic HTTPS with locally-trusted certificates
   - Reverse proxy to the bundler's dev server
   - WebSocket support for HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
   - Multiple domain support for testing various scenarios
   - Cross-bundler compatibility

3. **Implementation Phases**
   - Phase 1: Foundation - Set up project structure, core plugin factory, basic Caddy integration
   - Phase 2: Vite Integration - Focus on Vite first as the primary use case with HMR support
   - Phase 3: Features - Add HTTPS, reverse proxy, and configuration options
   - Phase 4: Expansion - Support other bundlers and create examples
   - Phase 5: Polish - Testing, documentation, and optimization

## What Got Implemented

### Core Features

1. **Caddy Server Management** (`src/caddy-server.ts`)
   - `CaddyServerManager` class that handles Caddy lifecycle
   - Automatic installation check with platform-specific installation instructions
   - Dynamic Caddyfile generation based on configuration
   - Proper cleanup on server shutdown

2. **Plugin Options** (`src/types.ts`)
   ```typescript
   export interface Options {
     https?: boolean // Enable HTTPS (default: true)
     host?: string // Host to bind (default: 'localhost')
     port?: number // Caddy port (auto-detected if not set)
     caddyfile?: string // Custom Caddyfile content or path
     caddyPath?: string // Path to Caddy executable
     domains?: string[] // Additional domains for HTTPS
     verbose?: boolean // Enable verbose logging
     env?: Record<string, string> // Custom environment variables
   }
   ```

3. **Bundler Integrations** (`src/index.ts`)
   - **Vite Integration**: Hooks into `configureServer` to start Caddy when Vite is ready
   - **Webpack Integration**: Uses compiler hooks for webpack-dev-server lifecycle
   - Automatic cleanup on process termination (SIGINT, SIGTERM)

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Beautiful console output with color-coded messages
   - Helpful error messages when Caddy is not installed
   - Banner display showing both Vite and Caddy URLs
   - Platform-specific installation commands

5. **Utilities** (`src/utilities/index.ts`)
   - `getInstallCommand()`: Returns platform-specific Caddy installation command
   - `formatCaddyError()`: Provides user-friendly error messages
   - `printBanner()`: Displays a formatted banner with server URLs

### Technical Implementation Details

1. **Caddyfile Generation**
   - Automatic HTTPS with local certificates
   - Reverse proxy configuration to the dev server
   - WebSocket support for HMR
   - CORS headers for development
   - Compression support (gzip/zstd)

2. **Port Management**
   - Automatic port detection using `get-port`
   - Default to port 4443 for Caddy
   - Configurable through options

3. **Process Management**
   - Uses `execa` for spawning Caddy process
   - Proper signal handling for graceful shutdown
   - Temporary file cleanup for generated Caddyfiles

### Playground Demo

Created a demonstration in the playground directory that:

- Shows HTTPS connection status
- Displays connection details (protocol, host, URL)
- Provides visual feedback for secure/insecure connections
- Lists available Caddy proxy URLs

## Summary of Accomplishments

### âœ… Completed Features

1. **Core Plugin Architecture**: Created an unplugin that works with multiple build tools (Vite, webpack, Rollup, etc.)

2. **Caddy Server Integration**:
   - Automatic Caddy server spawning and management
   - Installation check with helpful error messages
   - Platform-specific installation instructions

3. **HTTPS Support**:
   - Automatic HTTPS with locally-trusted certificates
   - Support for multiple domains
   - Configurable ports

4. **Development Features**:
   - Reverse proxy to bundler's dev server
   - WebSocket support for HMR
   - CORS headers for development
   - Compression (gzip/zstd)

5. **Developer Experience**:
   - Beautiful console output with status messages
   - Error handling with helpful messages
   - Verbose mode for debugging

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Implementation Highlights

- **Plugin Options**: Flexible configuration including HTTPS toggle, custom domains, port selection, and Caddyfile customization
- **Caddy Management**: Automatic lifecycle management (start/stop) tied to the dev server
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows with platform-specific installation guidance
- **Clean Architecture**: Modular code with separate utilities and server management

The plugin is now ready to use! Developers can simply install it and add it to their Vite config (or other bundler) to get automatic HTTPS in development with locally-trusted certificates.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import Caddy from 'unplugin-caddy/vite'
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    Caddy({
      https: true,
      host: 'localhost',
      domains: ['local.dev', 'app.local'],
      verbose: true,
    }),
  ],
})
```

After starting the dev server, developers can access their application via HTTPS at the Caddy proxy URL (e.g., `https://localhost:4443`) with a valid, locally-trusted certificate.
